     More Info:  See TechNote 2064

     Contains:   Double-underbar-prefixed availability macros, derived from
                 AvailabilityMacros.h

                 This header enables a developer to specify build time
//CMNT: c_keyword ^|                        constraints on what Mac OS X versions the resulting 
                 ras on what Mac OS X versions the resulting
                 application will be run.  There are two bounds a developer
                 can specify:
                 
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED
                      
                The lower bound controls which calls to OS functions will 
                be weak-importing (allowed to be unresolved at launch time).
                The upper bound controls which OS functionality, if used,
                will result in a compiler error because that functionality is
                not available on on any OS is the specifed range.
                
                For example, suppose an application is compiled with:
                
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MIN_REQUIRED = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_2
                      __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED  = __MAC_OS_X_VERSION_10_3
