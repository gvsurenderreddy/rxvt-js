A common misfeature is that the right half does not come back when a long
single-width line is set to double-width and then reset to single-width.

[?3l[2J[1;1HTest of known bugs in the DEC VT100 series. The numbering of some of
the bugs (A-F) refers to the article 'VT100 MAGIC' by Sami Tabih in
the 'Proceedings of the DEC Users Society' at St. Louis, Missouri, May
1983. To understand some of the tests, you have to look at the source
code or the article. Of course, a good VT100-compatible terminal
should not have these bugs (or have some means of disabling them)! If
a bug appears, you might want to RESET the terminal before continuing
the test. There is a test of the RESET function in the main menu.
